The success of our effort to uplift the African American male is the civil rights issue of this generation and has nothing to do with anyone else but us,  for it is our job. Mothers, grandmothers, teachers, caretakers, incarcerated parents and even the boys themselves have reached out to Alpha men for help. In order to be men, our boys must see men...Alpha Men!

-Brother Mark S. Tillman, 34th General President, Alpha Phi Alpha
